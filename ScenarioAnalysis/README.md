# Scenario extraction and analysis
In this project, the code to extract cut-in scenarios, especially overlap cut-in scenarios is given. Besides, a parameter analysis is conducted to generate distributions for scenario-based testing method. The driver behavior is also analyzed in congestion scenarios.

## Introduction
* Run **cutin_extraction.py** to extract cut-in scenarios from the dataset. Different types of cut-in can be obtained.
* Run **parameter_distribution.py** to generate parameter distributions for logical scenarios.
* Run **behavior_analysis.py** to analyze the driver behavior in congestion scenarios.
* The **road_geometry.py** includes the extraction of lane markings using the provided images in the dataset.
* The **utils.py** includes some general functions to handel the data.
